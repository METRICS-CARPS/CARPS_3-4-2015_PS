For this article you should focus on the findings reported in section "Primary outcome: pain-free range of
motion"

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Primary outcome: pain-free range of
motion

> The repeated measures ANOVA revealed a large overall
effect of visual-proprioceptive feedback (condition) on
pain-free range of motion F(2, 94) = 18.9, p < .001, Î·p2 = 0.29. All pairwise comparisons were significant (ps < .01). As shown in Figure 3, when vision understated true rotation,
pain-free range of motion was increased, and this
was a medium-sized effect, p = .006, d = 0.67; when
vision overstated true rotation, pain-free range of motion was decreased, and this was a large effect, p = .001, d = 0.80. Specifically, during visual feedback that understated
true rotation, pain-free range of motion was increased by
6% (95% confidence interval, or CI = [2%, 11%]); during
visual feedback that overstated true rotation, pain-free
range of motion decreased by 7% (95% CI = [3%, 11%]).
Therefore, our results show an overall effect of the
manipulation of 13%.
